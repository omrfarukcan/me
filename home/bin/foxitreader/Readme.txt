Notes
=======================================================================================================================
1. For Tar package installation, please note that the "fum.fhd" file has to be put into the same directory where the "FoxitReader" file is, so that you can use the help feature in Foxit Reader.
2. For Tar package installation, please note that the "fpdfcjk.bin" file has to be put into the same directory where the "FoxitReader" file is and also 
your system has to support displaying Chinese, Korean and Japanese normally, so that PDF files containing Chinese/Japanese/Korean fonts can be properly displayed.
